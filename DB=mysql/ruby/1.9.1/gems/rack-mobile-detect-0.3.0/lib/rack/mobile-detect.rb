  #
  # Rack::MobileDetect detects mobile devices and adds an
  # X_MOBILE_DEVICE header to the request if a mobile device is
  # detected.  The strategy for detecting a mobile device is as
  # follows:
  #
  # 1. Search for a 'targeted' mobile device. A targeted mobile device
  # is a mobile device you may want to provide special content to
  # because it has advanced capabilities - for example and iPhone or
  # Android device. Targeted mobile devices are detected via a Regexp
  # applied against the HTTP User-Agent header.
  #
  # By default, the targeted devices are iPhone, Android and iPod. If
  # a targeted device is detected, the token match from the regular
  # expression will be the value passed in the X_MOBILE_DEVICE header,
  # i.e.: X_MOBILE_DEVICE: iPhone
  #
  # 2. Search for a UAProf device. More about UAProf detection can be
  # found here:
  # http://www.developershome.com/wap/detection/detection.asp?page=profileHeader
  #
  # If a UAProf device is detected, the value of X_MOBILE_DEVICE is
  # simply set to 'true'.
  #
  # 3. Look at the HTTP Accept header to see if the device accepts WAP
  # content. More information about this form of detection is found
  # here:
  # http://www.developershome.com/wap/detection/detection.asp?page=httpHeaders
  #
  # Any device detected using this method will have X_MOBILE_DEVICE
  # set to 'true'.
  #
  # 4. Use a 'catch-all' regex. The current catch-all regex was taken
  # from the mobile-fu project. See:
  # http://github.com/brendanlim/mobile-fu
  #
  # Any device detected using this method will have X_MOBILE_DEVICE
  # set to 'true'.
  #
  # If none of the detection methods detected a mobile device, the
  # X_MOBILE_DEVICE header will be absent.
  #
  # Note that Rack::MobileDetect::X_HEADER holds the string
  # 'X_MOBILE_DEVICE' that is inserted into the request headers.
  #
  # Usage:
  # use Rack::MobileDetect
  #
  # This allows you to do mobile device detection with the defaults.
  #
  # use Rack::MobileDetect, :targeted => /SCH-\w*$|[Bb]lack[Bb]erry\w*/
  #
  # In this usage you can set the value of the regular expression used
  # to target particular devices. This regular expression captures
  # Blackberry and Samsung SCH-* model phones. For example, if a phone
  # with the user-agent: 'BlackBerry9000/4.6.0.167 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1 VendorID/102'
  # connects, the value of X_MOBILE_DEVICE will be set to 'BlackBerry9000'
  #
  # use Rack::MobileDetect, :catchall => /mydevice/i
  #
  # This allows you to limit the catchall expression to only the
  # device list you choose.
  #
  # See the unit test source code for more info.
