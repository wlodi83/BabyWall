== Examples

    The provided examples illustrate how to:
    - send a single email message in the simplest way
    - send one or more emails (where the email body is passed with the api call)
    - send one or more templated emails (where a key referencing a previously stored email body is passed with the api call)
    - create a mailing list, add and delete mailing list entries and list the existing mailing lists
    - list recent email unsubscribes
    - list recent email statistics
    - list recent delivery errors

== SSL Certificates

    If you encounter SSL certificate problems, use the cacert_info() method to specify a
    cacert.pem file (remember to specify the full path).

    The curl site has an up to date version of the file:

    http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem

== Tests
  To run the tests, issue the following command from the root of the project:
  bundle exec rspec spec/messagebus_ruby_api/client_spec.rb
